- 👋 Hi, I’m @robojets
- 👀 I’m interested in programing lego robots with python
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate our Robot code with FLL team all over the world 
- 📫 You can Email me to robojets.fll@gmail.com

**Who are we**
We are a team of 13 kids from Amal elementary School in Kfar Yona. 
On our spare time, we meet together to play, to learn Python and to work together to develp Lego made Robots.  

**Why are we sharing this repository**
We invested a lot of time and efforts to write this code and we belive that ths effort should not go to waste. 
So we would like to share our achievemnts with the comunity of EV3 Lego robotics enthusiastics and aspecialy with other FLL teams aroung teh glob.
if you find it usefull, we appritiate if you could also contribute your code changes and improvments to this project to make it even better.


**What is this reporsitory**
This repository was created to support easy programiing with Lego Mindstorms EV3 contorller when building a Lego Robot for FLL challenge competition.
Before you start using this reporsitory, in order to learn how to use MicroPython with an EV3 controller, we recommand that you will visit https://education.lego.com/en-us/product-resources/mindstorms-ev3/teacher-resources/python-for-ev3


**How to use this Repository**
Clone or download the repository to your local machine
We suggest to use VSCode with LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 MicroPython extention

The code architectire is devided to five parts:
1) Robot configuraiton 
2) Robot implementation
3) Master program
4) Roundes
5) main

First step is to go into the config.py file and modify the Robot configuraiton to match your own.
Next step that we recoomcand, in order to get familar with this code is to create your own round, try to add it to main.py and run the program.
Finaly, to implement more advance stuff, you can go into the robo.py and ealy add or modify the existing functionality.


Good luck from Robojets
